# Needed to do for the rethinking branch

* √ Fix locals/returns (rebind add_to_script, add_to_workspace, add_to_socket, delete_block events)
* √ Context blocks should only have one .locals (else, new block)
* √ Serialization, including version and plugins, ids for contained items
* √ Deserialization: rebuild view from serialized version
* Rename locals
* √ Split up plugins
* gist library
* UI for selecting plugins
* embedding
* x New dragging library?

## Serialization:

Block serialization should look like this. For each block, it will only have the fields which are relevant (i.e, values, contained, and next can all be undefined and unmentioned). Only signature is mandatory. Values can be literals or expression blocks. Contained must be a list of blocks (usually will be a list of one). If next is defined it must be exactly one block.
