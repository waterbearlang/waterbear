            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Welcome to the Waterbear project!</p>
            <p>Waterbear is a toolkit for creating drag-and-drop programming languages, with some example languages you can play around with and learn from. The goal is to make it easy to wrap other existing languages with Waterbear blocks to create draggable, snappable syntaxes for them.</p>
            <p>Waterbear is a toolkit for making programming more accessible and fun. Having a visual language means you don't have to focus on learning a syntax to start programming. Waterbear is good for kids, artists, and anyone who would like to make their computer do something new without having to become a "programmer" (although it could lead to that).</p>

            <p>Waterbear's system of draggable, snappable blocks, are built using clean HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. The goal is not to slavishly duplicate <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> (which was the inspiration for the blocks), or to create a programming language, but to create a visual syntax tool that can be used with a variety of languages and projects, and to make it as widely available as possible. Waterbear runs in a variety of web browsers, including Mobile Safari on the iPad.</p>
            
            <p>Waterbear is pre-alpha software, very raw, and in constant flux right now.</p>
