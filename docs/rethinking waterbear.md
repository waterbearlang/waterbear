# Rethinking Waterbear #

We have enough experience with waterbear now to be able to step back and take a look at what is working and what needs improvement. It's time to explore potentially radical changes before things get set in stone.

## Update 2012-08-30

For better detection of which slot/socket/next the block is being added or removed from, put its index into a data attribute on creation, pass that around during events.

How can Waterbear be more testable?

How can Waterbear block scripts (defined in the block definition json) be mult-line and generally more powerful?

## Update 2012-08-27

Events needed for blocks:

* Add next
* Remove next
* Add to context X
* Remove from context X
* Add to expression slot X
* Remove from expression slot X
* Add to workspace [foo]
* Remove from workspace [foo]
* Change expression literal from [foo] to [bar]
* Move from [expression socket X or workspace foo] to [expression socket Y or workspace bar]
* Move from [next | context X | workspace foo] to [next | context Y | workspace bar]
* Cut [block]
* Cut [block and children]
* Copy [block]
* Copy [block and children]
* Paste [block]
* Paste [block and children]
* Add block to [expression socket X | next | context X | workspace foo]
* Delete block from [expression socket X | next | context X | workspace foo]
* Clone block
* Edit block template
* Expand block (do we need to support persistence or undo/redo for these?)
* Collapse block
* Select block
* Start move

## Update 2012-08-04

If we allow event handlers to be declared in another context, there is really no difference between an event handler and any other context.

If contexts can be collapsed, and steps can be expanded, there is little difference between a context and a step.

If steps that return values can be used in place of expressions, and expressions can be used as steps, there is little difference between a step and an expression (unless the step doesn't return a value).

If you can open up any block for editing, one way to create new template blocks would be to clone an existing template block and modify it. So, blocks that can return values should be switchable between context and expression, but should it be implicit (drag over a socket and the block type changes) or explicit (a switch on each block). Should editing / cloning be handled by a special application mode or demi-mode, by a block halo, or by another switch? Adding a bunch of controls to each block might work passably on the desktop, but would be troublesome on a tablet. Maybe double click (or double-tap) could bring up a menu: clone, edit, expand/collapse, copy (instance), copy (instance and children), paste (insert after), cancel.

Should block editing be done in a modal?

Should editing a template block, when triggered from an instance (script block), change the instance's template to be that block?


## There are several types of blocks and more potential types of blocks

Current blocks:

* Trigger (on some event, do: )
* Step (Do this thing, then the next thing)
* Container (Do this with these steps, values)
* Value (Typed expression)

Other blocks that could be useful

* Function (given this, return this)
* Patch (given these inputs, do this, send to these outputs)
* Form (set several values together as a group)
* Object (like scratch sprites, have internal values and methods)
* Definition (create a new type of block)

Some blocks may want to change shape depending on context

* Color block may switch between RGB(A), CSV(A), colorwheel
* Some blocks may function as either steps or expressions

Blocks behave differently if they are in different contexts:

* On a menu (block templates)
* On a workspace (no effect unless they are a trigger or a definition
* On a specialized workspace (a sprite or object)
* Embedded in another block (everything except triggers)

Defining a new block

* Could be an object, with methods
* Could be a function
* How generic can we get?

Definition blocks are also top-level, like triggers

Sometimes definitions can be nested. Can triggers be nested?

BIG QUESTION: Should objects be workspaces (like in Scratch) or blocks?

What events should blocks support?

* Drag
* Over
* Out
* Drop - in block, in value slot, on workspace, on menu, on "trash"
* Scoping - when dragged to a new scope, or out of scope
* When parent/prototype goes out of scope

How should block changes be recorded for undo/redo?

How should blocks be represented?

* As definitions/prototypes?
* As stored scripts?
* As executable scripts?

Can blocks be steps *and* values?

How to collapse complex blocks or expand blocks? How to edit the representation? How to store new block templates on the menu?

Building the web: How to represent HTML, CSS, JS, Canvas, Audio, Video, SVG, networking, web workers, etc. without being overwhelming?

### Problems we've encountered so far ###

* Representing different languages
* Converting code -> blocks (round-tripping or blocks as a view of normal code)
* Finding the block you need (menu navigation)
* Types vs. flexibility
* Should objects be implicit or parameters?
* Explosion of block for different type signatures
* Really hard to test
* Types designated by color and/or shape run out of easily distinguished colors/shapes pretty fast.

For finding blocks, on the desktop text search helps to narrow down block choice, but a) not so great on tablet, and b) you have to know what you're looking for.

As an alternative, or supplement, to colors/shapes, perhaps add an icon to blocks to represent the type. The icon may also double as a return value? Perhaps a toggle to switch between step and expression?

## Libraries in use already ##

* beautify
* colorwheel
* highlight
* jquery
* jquery autogrowinput
* jquery gamequery
* jquery hotkeys
* json2
* prefixfree
* raphael
* raphael sketchy
* raphael path
* yepnope

## Libraries under consideration ##

* 3rd party drag / touch library
* More powerful color library with no dependency on Raphael
* Coffeescript
* Library for gists
* Backbone (implies underscore, jquery)
* Less/Sass

## Core of waterbear in 4 files ##

* blocks.js
* drag.js
* runtime.js
* workspace.js

### blocks.js ###

* utilities
* debugging
* jquery extensions for access

Making this use real JS objects (backbone models) could be a lot simpler. Also, using templates could avoid a lot of JQuery construction code. Could also clean up block language spec.

### drag.js ###

This would be ideal to move to a 3rd party library, but haven't found one that solves touch vs. mouse *and* waterbear's need to support tabs and slots for steps and sockets for values. Value sockets are pretty easy and there are newer libraries to manage touch vs. mouse. The final problem is with tabs and slots, which could be solved by relaxing that restriction. Now that scripts are basically linear anyway, we don't really need the Scratch metaphor for joining blocks together, and can use it only as a visual cue, but highlight the entire block when it is in a legal position in the script.

### runtime.js ###

Runtime has grown way too many specifics about the JS binding and types. It should really be just a touch of isolation (perhaps using an iframe) for scripts, and a timer for events.

### workspace.js ###

The workspace has all the primitive UI for the IDE, serialization and deserialization, and some even more primitive testing.

## Next Steps ##

* âˆš Convert blocks from JQuery to HTML templates
* Convert block data/methods to backbone models
* Use events pervasively
* Convert core to Coffeescript/Less
* Consider using oBloq
* Evaluate the newer touch libraries: 
  - https://github.com/bebraw/jswiki/wiki/Touch
  - https://github.com/cheeaun/tappable
  - https://github.com/alexgibson/tap.js/blob/master/tap.js
  - http://mwbrooks.github.com/thumbs.js/

## Moar future ##

* Plan for addressing all the issues on github
* Game lib for animation, sprites
* Immediate-style programming (see changes in view as code changes)
* A saturday-morning style cartoon show produced with Waterbear where kids can access all the scripts and assets to remix the cartoon each week and make their own.
* Make blocks more skinnable

## Goals and uses for waterbear

* Pedagogy: teaching / learning programming
* View source for visual programming
* Debugging (see the structure)
* Refactoring (group into blocks and move them around)
* Making programming friendly for non-programmers
* Saturday morning cartoon show
* Easy to write single-use or demo language, evolve languages from demo to demo
* Easy to embed scripts into web pages and ebooks
