# Needed to do for the rethinking branch

* gist library
* UI for selecting plugins

## Serialization:

Block serialization should look like this. For each block, it will only have the fields which are relevant (i.e, values, contained, and next can all be undefined and unmentioned). Only signature is mandatory. Values can be literals or expression blocks. Contained must be a list of blocks (usually will be a list of one). If next is defined it must be exactly one block.

``` json
{
    "waterbearVersion": "1.0",
    "plugins": [
        "javascript", // name or url
        "canvas"
    ],
    scripts: [ // 1 for each workspace?
        {
            "workspace": "default", // option to name workspaces?
            "blocks": [
                {
                    "signature": "...", // must have loaded plugins already
                    "values": [
                        {
                            // another block
                        },
                        10,
                        "2012-08-13 11:03:28.034Z",
                        "rgba(0,45,128,0.6)"
                    ],
                    "contained": [
                        // block(s)
                    ],
                    "next": // block
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
